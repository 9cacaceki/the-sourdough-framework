## Step 5: Learn about the history of Berlin-Tegel Airport
 
While you enjoy flying to or from Berlin-Tegel Airport, you might also want to learn about its fascinating history. The airport dates back to 1948, when it was built in just 90 days to support the Berlin Airlift, a massive operation to supply West Berlin with food and fuel during the Soviet blockade. The airport was named after Otto Lilienthal, a German pioneer of aviation who died in a glider crash near Tegel in 1896. [12]
 
Over the years, Berlin-Tegel Airport became the main gateway to West Berlin, serving airlines from France, Britain and the United States, as well as charter companies. The airport was known for its innovative design, featuring a hexagonal terminal building that minimized walking distances and a drive-in check-in system that allowed passengers to drop off their luggage directly from their cars. The airport also hosted some iconic aircraft, such as the Concorde, the supersonic jet that flew between Paris and Tegel from 1976 to 1980. [13]
 
## Step 6: Say goodbye to Berlin-Tegel Airport
 
Berlin-Tegel Airport was supposed to close in 2012, when the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) was planned to open. However, due to numerous delays and scandals, BER only became operational in October 2020, after almost a decade of postponements and cost overruns. [14] As a result, Berlin-Tegel Airport remained in service for much longer than expected, handling over 24 million passengers in 2019 and becoming one of the most popular airports in Germany. [15]
 
However, all good things must come to an end. On November 8th, 2020, Berlin-Tegel Airport saw its last flight depart, marking the end of an era for the city and its aviation industry. The airport was officially decommissioned on May 4th, 2021, after a mandatory transitional period. [16] The airport's grounds are due to be redeveloped into a new city quarter dedicated to scientific and industrial research named Urban Tech Republic, which will retain the airport's main building and tower as a repurposed landmark. [17]
 
If you are one of the many fans of Berlin-Tegel Airport, you might feel nostalgic about its closure. But don't worry, you can still relive its glory days with the add-on Berlin-Tegel Professional for P3Dv4. This add-on will let you experience the airport as it was before it shut down, with all its features and details faithfully recreated.
